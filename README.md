# Multi-Step Form with Validation
This project is a multi-step form built using React.js and Bootstrap. It includes client-side validation, error handling, and navigation controls. The form data is persisted to local storage and can be retrieved if the user revisits the form.
# Features
*Multi-step form with three steps
*Tabbed navigation to switch between steps.
*Form data validation with error messages and field highlighting.
*Local storage persistence for form data.
*Responsive design using Bootstrap.
#Instuctions
1.Filling the Form: Navigate through the steps by filling out the required fields. Validation errors will be displayed if any field is left empty or invalid.
2.Navigation: Use the "Next" and "Back" buttons to move between steps. The "Submit" button will appear on the final step to submit the form.
3.Data Persistence: The form data is saved to local storage when you navigate between steps. If you close the browser and revisit the form, the data will be pre-filled.
